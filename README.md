# InnoServeCrawler

## Overview
InnoServeCrawler is a project designed to collect and process data along with related media files from various sources. The project includes components for crawling data, processing competition results, and downloading associated media files.

## Project Structure
- **main.py**: The main entry point of the project.
- **.env**: Configuration file for environment variables.
- **competition_results.csv**: CSV file that holds processed competition results.
- **downloads/**: Directory containing various media files (e.g., MP3 and TXT files) related to competitions, events, or informational content.

## Setup & Installation
1. **Python Environment**  
   Ensure you have Python installed. It is recommended to use a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```
2. **Dependencies**  
   Install required packages (if any) by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(Note: Create a `requirements.txt` if external packages are used.)*

3. **Configuration**  
   Rename or update the `.env` file with the necessary configuration (such as API keys, database connection strings, etc.).

## Environment Configuration
Configure your environment by editing the `.env` file. Common configurations include:
- API keys
- Database connection strings
- Other environment-specific settings

## Tech Stacks
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Environment Management:** Virtual Environment (venv)
- **Version Control:** Git
- **Development Tools:** Visual Studio Code
- **Additional Tools:** Command-line interface (cmd) for executing scripts

## Usage
1. **Running the Crawler**  
   Execute the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   The script will perform the crawling operation, update competition results, and manage media downloads.

2. **Output Information**  
   - Processed results will be stored in `competition_results.csv`.
   - Downloaded media files will be saved in the `downloads/` folder.
